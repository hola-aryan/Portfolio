    <h3>The whole Timeline of making Railway Project</h3><br>

    <div>This Blog is incomplete ,Boring and Cringe as Aryan was not in good mood while writting this, and he dont want to delete this now.<br>

    <div>Ok, So I started this project back in December 18, 2022. I dont have any idea what I am doing and what are the problems I have to face while making this project. Shoutout to my MOM and DAD for not appreciating anything I do (zokes). So I basically scrolling reddit and saw someone designed ISRO Website and I was like cool Nigga. Then I remembered that I have to submit my Minor (underage) Project. So why not make something like this. I was watching ISRO website and I thought I cant add anything to this website other than contend and licking ass of sponsers who are going to fund their space project and then I thought naah Not worth it.<br>

    The Next Day December 19 2022, I went to college and then to library and people(Ankit) was showing his project to everyone. I saw that project and was like damn nigga this project is cool as fuck. It was school management system project (In which you can take attendance and show profile of student. If he is attending classes or not). So I decided to make something in which I have to add or delete the data. So the first idea was Tinder clone than I thought I have to make 2 different project types in that in one which they match with each other and other in which they talk like a chat app.Then I decided that I will make a blog page where I can add data from a form (Good Idea for Minor project in my head) So I started making it but specifically for Indian Railway. I just want to make this blog to look beautiful So I will add some random pictures in between.<br>

    After This I dont remember timeline as everything is messed up in my notepad. Next day I made the front part of the project basically I made everything but nothing is connected. Next day I came to know that Sidebar in the Employee end is not responsive. I started to make it responsive and fucked everything up. So I ended up removing SideBar after that I downloaded Vice City and played it for 2 days straight. Then if I get stuck in the game (the fkin Helicopter wala mission) so I continued working on the website again.<br>

    I was working on it on New Year and then this loneliness BT strike again as I left Journaling again (Bro the voices inside my head were so depressing that Night). I thought I was worthless, lonely mf and I want to change to get accepted by society. So I went to Insta and messaged everyone something. I never message someone at first place if I am doing so, something bad is happening in my life. Then I went back to my old route of motivating myself by watching Self Improvement channels, running and reading books(I read how to Win friends and influence people in 2 days) because I thought I am the so cruel Gian type person + the voices are telling me to kill myself as no one wished me on my birthday.<br>

    But remember bois after every lonely time I have a better software update Jan 2 Back to Journalling The God Complex Aryan is back to kill Lonely MF Aryan and killed him Successfully. Going to college on daily basis and making the project on like 4x speed than before. Learn how to create database, Update it, session, loda lehsun, then I remembered that I have done everything.  But if someone is visiting Railway website his main moto is to book ticket. Mind Fucked again. Started with deleting all the train data and added query to create a database and table whenever the employee add a new train. After that add a columnn to book ticket. Made everyhing on Jan 4<br>
   
    Then I started adding payment gateway on that night. Paytm Gateway website not authorizing me, Razorpay website is not authorizing me, stripe is saying that its services is not for India, cash free is also not working. At this point I was like fuck this project Jitna hua utna dikha dunga Par then I was like aur ek 2 try kar lete hain phir main gaya instamojo ke wesite pe aur mujhe laga ye konsi nalli website hai yahan to kuch nahin hoga ye bhi nahin chalegi. But after that wo chal gaya par bohot mashakkat karni padi.Aur finally I finished my Minor project or I say I finished in minor (its just a joke maybe dark or black so if you arrest me you are racist). Par As someone said and I quote <br><h4 style="text-align: center;">Anta bhala to sab bhala.</h4><br>
